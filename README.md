# Duo Task

This is a minimal full-stack app:  
- **Backend:** Flask (serves `/api/hello`, plus static React frontend)
- **Frontend:** React (Vite, in `/frontend/`), fetches `/api/hello` on load and displays the greeting.

## Running

The solution runs as a single container.  
Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t duo-flask-react .
docker run -e YOUR_NAME="Alice" -p 5500:5500 duo-flask-react
```
Navigate to [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500) to see the React UI.

### Continuous Integration / Deployment

GitHub Actions will automatically lint, build, and (optionally) publish the Docker image on every push and pull request to `main`:

- **Lint & build**:  
  - Checks out code, sets up Python 3.11, installs backend requirements, runs Flake8 on `app.py`
  - Sets up Node 18, installs frontend dependencies, runs `npm run build` to ensure React compiles
  - Builds the multi-stage Docker image as per the Dockerfile

- **DockerHub push**:  
  - On direct pushes to `main`, if the repository secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` are set, the image is pushed to Docker Hub as `${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/duo-flask-react:$SHORT_SHA`.
  - For PRs and other branches, the Docker push step is skipped.

**Required secrets:**
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (DockerHub Personal Access Token with `write:repo`/`push` permission)

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for full details.

### One-shot push to GitHub

To automate pushing this repository to GitHub (including first-time setup), use the helper script:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=... GITHUB_REPO=your-username/your-repo-name scripts/push_to_github.sh [branch]
```

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token (with repo rights) used for authentication.
- `GITHUB_REPO`: The repository, e.g. `username/repo-name`.
- `[branch]`: (Optional) Branch to push to. Defaults to `main`.

The script will:
- Initialise git if needed and set up the `main` branch.
- Commit changes if any.
- Add or update the `origin` remote using your token.
- Push to GitHub.

> **Note:** The script must be executable. If needed, run:  
> `chmod +x scripts/push_to_github.sh`

## Developing the React frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173 (proxy to Flaskâ€™s /api/hello if Flask is running on port 5500)
```
To apply changes to the production build, run `npm run build` and rebuild the Docker image.

## Environment

Set the environment variable `YOUR_NAME` to your name to have the app display your name in its welcome message. Otherwise, it will refer to you as "friend".

## NGINX/Reverse Proxy

The `nginx.conf` file can be used to configure an NGINX container to run as a reverse proxy to the Flask app container, effectively making the Flask application accessible on port `80`. You will need to know how to configure networks in Docker in order to achieve this.

```

# Batch Resume Parsing

This project supports batch parsing of resumes from PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files.

## Installing Dependencies

Make sure to install the new dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using the CLI

To parse all resumes under a directory, run:
```
python scripts/batch_resume_parser.py --input /path/to/resume/dir --output results.json
```
If you omit `--output`, the results will print to stdout.

## Using the API

A Flask API endpoint is available:

```
POST /api/parse-resumes
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Field: files (multiple file upload)
```

Example using `curl`:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5500/api/parse-resumes \
  -F "files=@/path/to/john_resume.pdf" \
  -F "files=@/path/to/jane_resume.docx"
```
The response will be:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "filename": "john_resume.pdf",
      "data": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
        "skills": ["Python", "Leadership", "..."],
        "raw_text": "...full resume text..."
      }
    },
    {
      "filename": "jane_resume.docx",
      "data": {
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
If a file fails to parse, `"error"` will be present instead of `"data"`.

CORS is enabled by default, so you can call this API from your frontend app.
